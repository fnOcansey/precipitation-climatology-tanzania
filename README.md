A drought is a period of time when an area or region experiences below-normal precipitation. The lack of adequate precipitation, either rain or snow, can cause reduced soil moisture or groundwater, diminished stream flow, crop damage, and a general water shortage. Droughts are the second-most costly weather events after hurricanes.

Tanzania is a country that frequently suffers from drought, and unfortunately is currently experiencing drought in the year 2022. This code using open data tools brings light to the phenomena, by providing a timeseries of rainfall, mean monthly rainfall data and, the spatial distribution of rainfall anomalies.
